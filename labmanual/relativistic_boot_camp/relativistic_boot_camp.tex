\textit{Students often struggle to solve problems that involve analyzing a series of events and worldlines in different reference frames.  Although there is no single recipe that can be applied to all possible relativistic physics problems, many problems can be broken down into a series of specific skills that you can practice.  This set of exercises is designed to provide practice in these specific skills.}

\textbf{Skill \#1: Draw Minkowski diagrams showing events and worldlines}

1.1. On a separate page, draw a Minkowski Diagram of the following events.  At time $t=0$, Bob flies away from Earth in his spacecraft at $0.6 c$.  After one year, Anna, who has stayed on Earth, realizes that Bob has forgotten his physics textbook at home.  She grabs the book and chases after him at speed $0.9 c$.  Once she catches up to him and gives him the book, she immediately turns around and returns home at $0.8 c$.  
\bigskip

1.2 On a separate page, draw a Minkowski Diagram of the following events.  The starship Enterprise is stationary with respect to the Earth, 4~light years away from it.  While idling, the ship's warp drive fails, and at $t=0$ they limp back to Earth at speed $0.4 c$.  At the moment they head towards Earth, they radio a message to Earth that they are coming.  A supply vessel is already en route From the Earth to the Enterprise at $0.6 c$, and they intercept the message when the supply vessel is exactly 2~light years away from Earth.  The supply vessel continues on course towards the Enterprise at the same speed until the two ships rendezvous.  
\bigskip

1.3. On a separate page, draw a Minkowski Diagram of the following events.  Anna buys a cheap used car from Craigslist and installs a hyperdrive engine in it, enabling the car to travel at $0.5 c$.  Unfortunately, she is too focused on the propulsion system and neglects some of the other amenities.  
As she drives down the road starting from $x=0$ and $t=0$ at top speed, Bob (stationary at $x=0$) witnesses various parts fall off the car: 
the rear bumper at $ct=100$ meters, the front bumper at $ct=200$ meters, the hood ornament at $ct=300$ meters, and the muffler at $ct=400$ meters (all times in Bob's reference frame).  
The light from the event of the muffler falling off takes some time to reach Bob.  
At $ct=100$ meters after that light \textit{reaches} him, he beams a text message at speed $c$ directly to Anna to taunt her.  As it happens, Bob sends the text message at exactly the same time (in Bob's reference frame) that Anna's rear axle breaks, bringing her car to a sudden halt.  At the very instant that Anna receives the text from Bob, she texts back telling Bob to put a sock in it.  (We assume that Anna has infinitely fast reflexes and prodigiously dexterous thumbs.)  
At $ct=100$ meters after sending the text to Bob, Anna sends another text to Carl in the opposite direction, offering him a good deal on a late model Corolla.

\textbf{Skill \#2: Visualize how Minkowski diagrams change under Lorentz transformation}

2.1 Draw a qualitative Minkowski diagram of the events in problem 1.1 from Bob's reference frame.  
\bigskip

2.2 Draw a qualitative Minkowski diagram of the events in problem 1.2 from the reference frame of the supply vessel.  
\bigskip

2.3 Draw a qualitative Minkowski diagram of the events in problem 1.3 from Anna's reference frame.

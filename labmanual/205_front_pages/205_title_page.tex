This manual is a set of exercises for use in the sophomore level course ``Modern Physics'' at the University of Richmond, covering various topics in special relativity and quantum mechanics.  The exercises are mostly intended as in-class activities, or ``Labs,'' though they're kind of fake labs in that they don't use any physical equipment beyond a computer and some software, at most.

Several of the quantum mechanics labs use software developed by Wolfgang Christian and Mario Belloni at Davidson College.  MT also gratefully acknowledges the advice and assistance of Ted Bunn, both for fielding specific Mathematica questions and for many helpful discussions about teaching this course.

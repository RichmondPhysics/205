This manual is a set of exercises for use in the sophomore level course ``Modern Physics'' at the University of Richmond.  They are mostly intended as in-class activities, or ``Labs,'' though theyâ€™re kind of fake labs in that they don't use any physical equipment beyond a computer and some software, at most.  The labs cover various topics in Special Relativity and Quantum Mechanics.

Most of these exercises were developed by Matt Trawick and used as handouts over several years of teaching this course before being compiled into this manual in 2015.  The Einstein Solid lab was written by Jerry Gilfoyle.  Three of the quantum mechanics labs use software developed by Wolfgang Christian and Mario Belloni at Davidson College.  MT also gratefully acknowledges the advice and assistance of Ted Bunn, both for fielding specific Mathematica questions and for many helpful discussions about teaching this course.
